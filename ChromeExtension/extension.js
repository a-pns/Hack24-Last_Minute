Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing.

A chimeric LigB Ig-like domain was evaluated for the potential to elicit an immune response to multiple regions of LigB and to thereby enhance vaccine protection against leptospiral infection. The chimera LigB10-B7-B7 (β-strands A-C: B10 and β-strands C\u2032-F and G-G\u2032: B7) was chosen as the best candidate for animal studies because the chimeric domain possesses the ability to bind highly bactericidal mAbs specific to each parent domain (<a href=\"/articles/30051/figures#fig6s1\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1<\/a>). Additionally, LigB10-B7-B7 was similar to wild-type LigB7 and LigB10 in protein expression levels and in overall secondary structure (circular dichroism analysis, <a href=\"/articles/30051/figures#fig7s1\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1<\/a>). To generate a protective response, hamsters were immunized with 50 µg of LigB7, LigB10, LigB10-B7-B7, or PBS (as a negative control) for two times at 3 week intervals, and then challenged with 2.5 × 10<sup>2<\/sup> of triple passages of <i>L. interrogans<\/i> Pomona (<a href=\"#bib11\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Conrad et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#bib27\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Kunjantarachot, 2014<\/a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7A<\/a>). On day 8, the leptospiral challenge was lethal for five of six hamsters inoculated with PBS group, three of five hamsters inoculated with wild-type LigB7, and four of five hamsters inoculated with wild-type LigB10. By day 10, all of the wild-type LigB7 and LigB10 immunized hamsters had either died or were euthanized due to severe clinical signs. In contrast, all five of the hamsters that had been inoculated with LigB10-B7-B7 and subsequently challenged with <i>Leptospira<\/i> survived until the end of the experiment (day 21 post infection). The survival rate of the LigB10-B7-B7 group is significantly higher (100%) than either control group (17%) or individual wild-type domain groups (0%) (p&lt;0.05).<\/p>    <div id=\"fig7\" class=\"asset-viewer-inline asset-viewer-inline--\" data-variant=\"\" data-behaviour=\"AssetViewer ToggleableCaption\" data-selector=\".caption-text__body\" data-asset-viewer-group=\"fig7\" data-asset-viewer-uri=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/,1500/0/default.jpg\" data-asset-viewer-width=\"1339\" data-asset-viewer-height=\"1500\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">          <div class=\"asset-viewer-inline__header_panel\">          <div class=\"asset-viewer-inline__header_navigation\"><span class=\"asset-viewer-inline__previous\"><\/span><span class=\"asset-viewer-inline__next asset-viewer-inline__next--active\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"asset-viewer-inline__header_text\">            <span class=\"asset-viewer-inline__header_text__prominent\">Figure 7<\/span> with 4 supplements           <\/div>                    <div class=\"asset-viewer-inline__figure_access\">              <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/download/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9kLS1jZG4taWlpZi5lbGlmZXNjaWVuY2VzLm9yZy9sYXg6MzAwNTEvZWxpZmUtMzAwNTEtZmlnNy12Mi50aWYvZnVsbC9mdWxsLzAvZGVmYXVsdC5qcGc=/elife-30051-fig7-v2.jpg?_hash=fVRfEePB9gkI3JDmzwhVNElMd8lzyTGDqwPM5y8ZuZw%3D\" class=\"asset-viewer-inline__download_all_link\" download=\"Download\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Download asset<\/span><\/a>              <a href=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/,1500/0/default.jpg\" class=\"asset-viewer-inline__open_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Open asset<\/span><\/a>            <\/div>          <\/div>              <figure class=\"captioned-asset\">                        <a href=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/,1500/0/default.jpg\" class=\"captioned-asset__link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">              <picture class=\"captioned-asset__picture\">                  <source srcset=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/1234,/0/default.webp 2x, https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/617,/0/default.webp 1x\" type=\"image/webp\">                  <source srcset=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/1234,/0/default.jpg 2x, https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/617,/0/default.jpg 1x\" type=\"image/jpeg\">                  <img src=\"https://prod--cdn-iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:30051/elife-30051-fig7-v2.tif/full/617,/0/default.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"captioned-asset__image\">              <\/picture>              <\/a>                                                      <figcaption class=\"captioned-asset__caption\">                            <h6 class=\"caption-text__heading\"><i>Leptospira<\/i> lethal challenge of hamsters immunized with LigB Ig-like domains.<\/h6>                                                <div class=\"caption-text__body\"><p class=\"paragraph\">(<b>A<\/b>) Survival rates for groups of six immunized hamsters are shown for the 3 weeks post leptospiral challenge.

The sera from LigB domain immunized hamsters provided a strong antibody response against the corresponding immobilized recombinant LigB domain (<a href=\"/articles/30051/figures#fig7s2\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2<\/a>). LigB7, LigB10, and LigB10-B7-B7 boosters were able to further enhance the antibody response. The Anti-LigB10-B7-B7 sera was also reactive with wild-type LigB7 and LigB10 but failed to react with the negative control, LigB12. LigB10-B7-B7 <span class=\"entity6\">immunization<\/span> led to an increase in post-booster secondary response for IgG but not IgM antibodies implying the generation of a typical immune memory response (<a href=\"/articles/30051/figures#fig7s3\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3<\/a>). The serological tests indicate that targeted antibodies can be effectively generated by vaccines based on individual LigB Ig-like domains and chimeric domains.<\/p><p class=\"paragraph\">Several complementary methods were employed to test for the vaccine\u2019s ability to reduce bacterial burdens of host tissue. Liver, kidney, and urinary bladder tissue from all <span class=\"entity6\">immunization<\/span> groups were examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to identify the <i>Leptospira<\/i> specific gene, LipL32 (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7B<\/a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Levett et al., 2005<\/a>; <a href=\"#bib21\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Haake et al., 2000<\/a>). The hamster group that received immunizations containing recombinant chimeric protein, LigB10-B7-B7, exhibited a significant reduction in leptospiral burden when compared to bacterial loads from wild-type LigB7 or LigB10 immunized hamsters. The immunized hamsters were further examined for histopathologic changes of livers, kidneys and lungs (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7C\u2013H<\/a> and <a href=\"/articles/30051/figures#fig7s4\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4<\/a>). Except for one apparently normal hamster from PBS group, all other hamsters from PBS, LigB7 and LigB10 <span class=\"entity6\">immunization<\/span> groups presented severe clinical signs and prominent macroscopic lesions on spirochete-targeted organs (<span class=\"entity5\">e.g. multifocal pulmonary ecchymoses<\/span>, icteric liver and enlarged kidney). Lung lesions included thickening of alveolar septa due to edema, interstitial leukocytes infiltration, endothelial cell swelling, and extensive hemorrhage (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7C<\/a>). Leptospira-infected livers were infiltrated by various <span class=\"entity1\">inflammatory cells<\/span>, indicating moderate to severe hepatitis. Focal necrosis was also found in parenchymal hepatocytes, leading to loss of normal tissue integrity (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7D<\/a>). Severe tubulointerstitial nephritis with locally extensive hemorrhage in uriniferous spaces and tubules was present in Leptospira-infected kidneys (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7E<\/a>). Furthermore, greater than 50% of renal tubules were lost and replaced by lymphoplasmacytic cells infiltration and <span class=\"entity8\">severe fibrosis<\/span>. In contrast, all hamsters immunized with chimeric LigB10-B7-B7 presented no visible macroscopic/microscopic lesions in livers, kidneys or lungs (<a href=\"#fig7\" data-behaviour-initialised=\"true\">Figure 7F\u2013H<\/a>). In agreement with high survival rate of LigB10-B7-B7 immunized hamsters, vaccines containing the chimeric antigen provide superior protection and potentially sterilizing immunity for the animals from leptospiral infection.<\/p>  <\/div><\/section>"
